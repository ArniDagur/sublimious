# Rock your SublimeText with VIM keybindings and Sublimious!

```
Sublimious is configuration system for SublimeText to make it act like VIM - just better.
```
### Install
for the moment, sublimious is not hosted on package control yet. To install, clone this repository into your `User` directory.

__Be warned__! Sublimious is a complete configuration system and will nuke your existing configuration. Make sure to backup your configs before trying sublimious!

### Configuration
By default, sublimious will read your `~/.sublimious` configuration file. If you don't have one yet, just copy the the `.sublimious` file out of this repository (under `template/`) and put it in your home directory. From now on, all you have to maintain is your sublimous config which will then take care of your sublime config.

### Keybindings

Coming soon.
