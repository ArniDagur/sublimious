# General To-Dos:

- add README files for each layer

- Find a way to tell Package Control to reload
- Add a better color scheme
- Find a way to map package specific configurations into package specific config files (they can't stay in the global packages sadly :()
- Add a nice screenshot to README
- Add install instructions to README
- Submit to package control
